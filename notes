Prepare to work by running this command:
rvm use 1.9.3

Testing by running these commands:

bundle exec bin/sendgrid -u EastBaySoftware -p g72XwFd5o \
customer_add -u my_username8

bundle exec bin/sendgrid -u EastBaySoftware -p g72XwFd5o \
customer_profile_get

bundle exec bin/sendgrid -u EastBaySoftware -p g72XwFd5o \
customer_enable -u my_username10

There needs to be some sort
of defaulting mechanism (~/.sendgridrc, maybe?), because there are so
many parameters. Currently, everything just defaults to "default".

Also, sometimes the HTTP query will return something other than 200.
We'll need to handle that.

This is Asher's api_user and api_password:
'EastBaySoftware', 'g72XwFd5o'

Continue adding more methods. The next one is "Update Subuser Username".
It will be interesting to figure out which name is an email name, and
which is not.
