Prepare to work by running this command:
rvm use 1.9.3

Testing by running these commands:

bundle exec bin/sendgrid -u EastBay Software -p g72XwFd5o \
customer_add -u my_username8

bundle exec bin/sendgrid -u EastBaySoftware -p g72XwFd5o customer_profile

The "customer_profile" invocation is almost working. I just need to
handle (and display) the list of customers that comes back.

There needs to be some sort
of defaulting mechanism (~/.sendgridrc, maybe?), because there are so
many parameters. Currently, everything just defaults to "default".

Also, sometimes the HTTP query will return something other than 200.
We'll need to handle that.

This is Asher's api_user and api_password:
'EastBaySoftware', 'g72XwFd5o'
